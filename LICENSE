## Copyright Notice

There are verbatim definitions in the word list from various online dictionaries that are probably copyrighted. I don't think that I've copied enough of the respective dictionaries to violate copyright laws, and when I originally captured the words I usually sited the source for the definition though I may have missed some. There are also quotes that are attributed to various books located in the journal pages with attributions when available. Please keep this in mind if you use this code. The rest of the code is published under the MIT license.
